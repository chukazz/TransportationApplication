# :airplane: Airline-Microservices

`Airline Microservice` is a simple Airline application that has the basic business scenario for `online reserving flight ticket`. Airlines provide transport services for their passengers. All operations of an airline company are controlled by their airline management system.

## :rocket: The Goals of This Project

- The microservices base on `Domain Driven Design (DDD)` implementation.
- Correct separation of bounded contexts for each microservice.
- Communications between bounded contexts through asynchronous `MessageBus` and `events`.
- Simple `CQRS` implementation and event driven architecture.
- Using [Inbox Pattern](https://event-driven.io/en/outbox_inbox_patterns_and_delivery_guarantees_explained/) for guaranty message [Idempotency](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/IdempotentReceiver.html) for receiver microservice and [Exactly-once Delivery](https://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/exactly_once_delivery/) pattern and using [Outbox Pattern](https://event-driven.io/en/outbox_inbox_patterns_and_delivery_guarantees_explained/) for ensuring about any message lost and [At-Least one Delivery](https://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/at_least_once_delivery/) rule.
- Using `Best Practice` and `New Technologies` and `Design Patterns`.
- Using Docker-Compose and Kubernetes for our deployment mechanism. 

## :dart: Plan

## :high_brightness: The Domain And Bounded Context - Service Boundary

- `Identity Service`: The Identity Service is a bounded context for authenticate and authorize users through with [Identity Server](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer). Also, this service is responsible for creating users and their corresponding roles and permission with using [.Net Core Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity) and Jwt authentication and authorization.

- `Flight Service`: The Flight Service is a bounded context for all operation related to flight and get available filght and seat.

- `Passenger Service`: The Passenger Service is a bounded context for managing our passengers information, track the activities and subscribing to get notification for out of stock products

- `Reservation Service`: The Passenger Service is a bounded context for managing all operation related to reserve flight ticket.



## :hammer: Structure of Project

I used a [mediator pattern](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2019/04/30/the-mediator-pattern-in-net-core-part-1-whats-a-mediator/) with using [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) library in my controllers for a clean and [thin controller](https://codeopinion.com/thin-controllers-cqrs-mediatr/), also instead of using a `application service` class because after some times our controller will depends to different services and this breaks single responsibility principle. We use mediator pattern to manage the delivery of messages to handlers. One of the advantages behind the [mediator pattern](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/) is that it allows the application code to define a pipeline of activities for requests . For example in our controllers we create a command and send it to mediator and mediator will route our command to a specific command handler in application layer.

To support [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and [Don't Repeat Yourself principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), the implementation of cross-cutting concerns is done using the mediatr [pipeline behaviors](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/wiki/Behaviors) or creating a [mediatr decorators](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/).

Also in this project I used mix of [clean architecture](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/) and [vertical slice architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) and also I used [feature folder structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) in this project.

Also here I used cqrs for decompose my features to very small parts that make our application

- maximize performance, scalability and simplicity.
- adding new feature to this mechanism is very easy without any breaking change in other part of our codes. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.
- easy to maintain and any changes only affect on one command or query and avoid any breaking changes on other parts
- it gives us better separation of concerns and cross cutting concern (with help of mediatr behavior pipelines) in our code instead of a big service class for doing a lot of things.

I treat each request as a distinct use case or slice, encapsulating and grouping all concerns from front-end to back.
When adding or changing a feature in an application in n-tire architecture, we are typically touching many different "layers" in an application. we are changing the user interface, adding fields to models, modifying validation, and so on. Instead of coupling across a layer, we couple vertically along a slice. we `Minimize coupling` `between slices`, and `maximize coupling` `in a slice`.

With this approach, each of our vertical slices can decide for itself how to best fulfill the request. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.

![](./assets/Vertical-Slice-Architecture.jpg)

With using CQRS pattern, we cut each business functionality into some vertical slices, and inner each of this slices we have [technical folders structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders) specific to that feature (command, handlers, infrastructure, repository, controllers, ...). In Our CQRS pattern each command/query handler is a separate slice. This is where you can reduce coupling between layers. Each handler can be a separated code unit, even copy/pasted. Thanks to that, we can tune down the specific method to not follow general conventions (e.g. use custom SQL query or even different storage). In a traditional layered architecture, when we change the core generic mechanism in one layer, it can impact all methods.
